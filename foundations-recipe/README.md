Assignment instructions:

1. Initial Structure: Create a main page for your recipe collection. This main page should have a title that says "Odin Recipes."

2. Recipe Page: Create a separate page for a specific recipe. This page should be located in a folder named "recipes" and should have a title that is the name of the recipe you're featuring.

3. Recipe Page Content: On the specific recipe page, include the following:

- A picture of the completed dish.
- A section titled "Description" that contains one or two paragraphs describing what the dish is.
- A section titled "Ingredients" that lists all the ingredients needed for the dish.
- A section titled "Steps" that lists, in order, the steps required to make the dish.

4. Add More Recipes: Create two more recipe pages that follow the same structure as the first. Make sure to add links to these new recipe pages on your main recipe collection page. Arrange these links in a list format.
